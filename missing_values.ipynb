    "Handling missing values is a common step in data preprocessing. The approach you choose to handle these values depends on the nature of your data and the problem you're trying to solve. Here are a few common strategies:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Removing Rows with Missing Values: This is a direct method but might result in loss of data.\n",
    "- Filling with Mean/Median/Mode: For numerical columns, you can fill missing values with the mean or median. For categorical columns, the mode is often used.\n",
    "- Filling with a Constant Value: Sometimes, filling missing values with a specific constant (like 'Unknown' or 0) might make sense based on domain knowledge.\n",
    "- Using Interpolation: This method can be useful for time series data.\n",
    "- Predictive Filling: Models like k-Nearest Neighbors or regressions can be used to predict and fill missing values.\n",
